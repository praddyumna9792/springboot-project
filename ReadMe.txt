    3) infrastructure contains all the implements classes as the technique details

Darabase
It uses a H2 in memory database(for easy local test), can be changed easily in the application.properties for any other database.

Getting Started

You'll need Java 8 installed

About the code:
This project entity having different layers like:
 1) project:
	This is entry point of project.
